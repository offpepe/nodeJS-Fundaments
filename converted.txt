hi, my name is alan, i'm a junior dev full stack and i'm afraid, afraid of what future brings
ifraid about what i'll leave in this world, we had saw a lot of content every day, so mutch
content that we can't even remember why that was created, maybe the time that we used to study
a book many times to understand what was the message that the creator give to us gone, and is the 
time to eat so mutch that i'll explode and inside of us, will have a lot of images and words but 
with no context, no form, just what used to be thoghts, parts of the organic world.
